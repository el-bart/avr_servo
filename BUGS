* when moving one servo very fasy (i.e. w/o waiting for reply), others do move as well
  (they shake a little)... the problem appears to be communication that forces interrupts
  during servos phase generation, making it last longer. beside interrupts also ocasionally
  make whole cycle longer, therefor servos shake. probably reimplementing queues, so that
  they won't be cyclic, but will be exchangable instead will do the trick.
* when making processing longer then half of the cycles many packages get broken during
  communication. this is a funny thing, since cycleLen/2 is a magic value for everything
  to work fine. it must be analyzed some more...
