* add command queue on the device.
* add moving with different speeds.
* add more I/O operations (no computations for the chrono table though!).
* implement asynchronous communication in the driver using future/promise mechanism.

consider:
* add "BURST" command to set all servos to a given poistions.
* improve I/O speed, using new 16MHz quartz.
* consider adding more precition to controling servos (few extra bits?).
